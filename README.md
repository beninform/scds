 Swansea Clinical Decision Support

 A project to explore and develop what high-quality clinical decision support will look like. The project aims to work with clinicians as stakeholders and as co-creators to enable the development of decision support tools that support good clinical practice.

 The first phase of the project involves a series of online user-studies exploring the key characteristics of an AI-driven decision support tool that make it trustworthy to clinicians.

 Code in this repo is merely the project web pages.
