edited htaccess to replace tilde with %7e. But that came out as e in url. So changed it back (No net change).

edited join.php to alter the href for the signup page, putting a $root variable in front. But that didn't fix the cached redirect issue (new private browser did!). So changed it back (no net change).
<?php echo $root; ?>scds/
